    """
    Append a structured record of this interaction to the audit log.

    TODO — Milestone 3:

    Before writing any code, complete specs/auditor-spec.md. The key decisions
    are what fields to log, how much of the question and response to include,
    and how to handle the logs/ directory not existing yet.

    Each record should be a JSON object written as a single line to LOG_FILE
    (defined in config.py as "logs/audit.jsonl").

    Required fields:
      - "timestamp"        : ISO 8601 datetime string
      - "tier"             : the safety tier assigned to this question
      - "question"         : the user's question (truncate to 300 chars if longer)
      - "response_preview" : first 200 characters of the response

    If the logs/ directory doesn't exist, create it before writing.

    Also print a one-line summary to the terminal so you can see logged
    interactions in real time without opening the file:
      e.g. [LOGGED] tier=caution | "How do I replace a faucet?" → 47 chars

    Design your log entry in specs/auditor-spec.md before implementing here.
